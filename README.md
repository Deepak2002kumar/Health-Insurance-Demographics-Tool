## About Dataset
This dataset contains information on the relationship between personal attributes (age, gender, BMI, family size, smoking habits), geographic factors, and their impact on medical insurance charges. It can be used to study how these features influence insurance costs and develop predictive models for estimating healthcare expenses.

- Age: *The insured person's age.*
- Sex: *Gender (male or female) of the insured.*
- BMI (Body Mass Index): *A measure of body fat based on height and weight.*
- Children: *The number of dependents covered.*
- Smoker: *Whether the insured is a smoker (yes or no).*
- Region: *The geographic area of coverage.*
- Charges: *The medical insurance costs incurred by the insured person.*

## Features

The Dashboard contains Interactive data filtering (by smoker status, gender, etc.) along with Visual representation of age distribution, average charges, and BMI correlation.

        Slicers are being used to maintain the interactivity of a dashboard.

## Analysis and Insights

### [ 1 ] Total Insurance Amount:

- The total insurance amount is $1,775,582,824.99, indicating a large dataset and significant coverage.

### [ 2 ] Gender Distribution:

- The dataset consists of 1,338 total insurance holders.
- Male: 676 holders (50.52% of total).
- Female: 662 holders (49.48% of total).
- Both genders are almost equally represented, with a slightly higher percentage of male policyholders.

### [ 3 ] Average Charges:

### [ 4 ] Smoker vs. Non-Smoker Distribution:

- 20% of the insurance holders are smokers, while 80% are non-smokers.
- This could indicate a preference for healthier lifestyles or more expensive premiums for smokers

### [ 5 ] Age Distribution:

- The majority of the policyholders are in the 18-30 age group (444 holders).
- The distribution decreases as age increases:

    - 40-50: 281 holders.
    - 50-60: 265 holders.
    - 60+: 91 holders.
- Younger people tend to have more policies, potentially due to lower costs and higher health risks in older age.

### [ 6 ] Average Insurance Charges by Age and Gender:

- The average charges increase with age for both males and females, peaking in the 60+ age group.
- This trend reflects the increasing health risks and associated costs as people age.

### [ 7 ] Insurance Charges by BMI:

- There is a scatter plot showing a positive correlation between BMI and insurance charges. As BMI increases, insurance charges tend to rise, possibly due to the associated health risks with higher BMI.
